  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of EZJob Platform Iteration 3 with 6 job sources and Resend email integration. Backend achieved 87.5% success rate (21/24 tests) with all new features operational. 6-source job ingestion successfully fetches from remotive (22), weworkremotely (50), hackernews (100), indeed (0), linkedin (30), github_jobs (0) - rate limiting expected for some sources. Email notifications working with Resend API (domain validation error expected). Frontend loads correctly but requires OAuth authentication for full testing.",
